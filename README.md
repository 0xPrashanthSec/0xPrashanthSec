## 🚀 About Me

I’m a cybersecurity professional with 6+ years of experience in Security Operations Center (SOC) environments, specializing in threat hunting, malware analysis, and SIEM engineering. I lead SOC teams through critical incidents, build scalable detection frameworks, and develop automation tools that reduce time-to-detection and improve operational efficiency.

I’m passionate about purple teaming, open-source contributions, and building tools that empower defenders. My work has been recognized by Oracle, Trip Advisor, Dell, and the Government of India for impactful vulnerability disclosures.
